<p>This is a little rust app that scrubs SVGs
  that come out of the 
  <a href="https://concepts.app/en/">Concepts</a> app
  to get them ready for my site. 
</p>
<p>
  Check out <a href="https://github.com/alanwsmith/svg-scrubber">the source code</a>
  if you want to take a look.

<h2>Example</h2>
