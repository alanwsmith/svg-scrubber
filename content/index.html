<p>This is a little rust app that scrubs SVGs
  that come out of the 
  <a href="https://concepts.app/en/">Concepts</a> app
  to get them ready for my site. 
</p>
<p>
  Check out <a href="https://github.com/alanwsmith/svg-scrubber">the source code</a>
  if you want to take a look.
</p>

<hr />

<p>Or, at least. That was the plan. I've 
  since figured out that the Concepts app has
  built-in 3x5 note cards and paper textures.
  That's effectively what I set up. So,
  don't need this code at all, but it
  was still fun to do
